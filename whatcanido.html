			<h1>My Abilities, A Portfolio.</h1>
			<p>In a world where everyone has their own talents and capabilities, I believe that we should all celebrate our own individual strengths. This page is where I'll be able to share mine, and maybe, you can find one that best suits what you need. Here's a list of my top five for you to look at. </p>

	<h1>Five Things I'm Great At (don't worry, there's a lot more)</h1>
	</div>
</section>

	<section class="ability1">
	<div class="ability1-container">
			<h2>ONE: Communication</h2>
			<h3>I'm known for how well I can articulate my thoughts, and use these ideas to make change. In other words, I communicate well. Whether this is through spoken, written, or visual means, my communication proficiency stands out. Not only does this enhance the clarity of my message, but it allows for a greater connection with others.</h3>

<section class="ability2">
	<div class="ability2-container">
			<h2>TWO: Creativity</h2>
			<h3>Albert Einstein once said, "Creativity is intelligence having fun." I strive to live by this quote because, in a world of ideas, you need creativity to execute them. My approach toward projects extends beyond the facts or the execution, to how unique a project can be. Whether it's inventive strategies, consideration of a second narrative, or expressing these through unique mediums, I can guarantee I'll do my best to create work that captivates and inspires.</h3>

<section class="ability3">
	<div class="ability3-container">
			<h2>THREE: Languages</h2>
			<h3>My proficiency in four languages is a great resource for anyone looking for effective communication. Not only is it a way to connect and communicate, but it's also a skill that allows me to collaborate on projects; multilingually. I'm also very open to learning more languages, by 2028 I hope to know a minimum of six. </h3>

<section class="ability4">
	<div class="ability4-container">
			<h2>FOUR: Spelling</h2>
			<h3>I'm a great speller, you can ask anyone, even the Scripps National Spelling Bee. My amazing spelling skills not only ensure that any email, essay, or presentation I write will be clear and concise, but it also adds to a positive consumer experience. This attention to detail reflects a dedication to high-quality material and a guarantee of polished interaction. </h3>

<section class="ability5">
	<div class="ability5-container">
			<h2>FIVE: Efficiency</h2>
			<h3>My efficiency is a key point that directly benefits everyone. By consistently completing tasks and services in a timely matter, I ensure that I'm able to complete as many tasks as possible. This efficiency can be reflected in quicker replies to texts or questions, prompt decision-making, and the quick execution of projects. (just like this one!) Ultimately, my efficiency demonstrates, reliability, responsiveness, and dedication towards my work.</h3>
