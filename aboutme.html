			<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
			<p>I'm Annette. I'm fourteen years old, and an eighth grade student. I'm Taiwanese-Filipino, a polyglot, and most importantly, a person. I love many things; My family, my friends, the music I listen to, the experiences I've had, and the ones that will come. I want to be succeed, I want to study Biotechnology in college, go to medschool shortly after, and become a derematologist. I could go on about everything I've truly wanted in life, but most importantly, I want to be more than what's expected from me. </p>
